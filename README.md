# raytracer
## An OpenGL 2 Raytracer

NB That this project was created from a skeleton of objects for my class COSC363 - Computer Graphics.
The skeleton - the base project without my additions - can be found in the `skeleton` directory.

Build with: `g++ -Wall -o RayTracer *.cpp -lm -lGL -lGLU -lglut && ./RayTracer`, making sure that you have OpenGL 2 (ew) installed.
If you're using fish (or some other non-POSIX shell), use `g++ -Wall -o RayTracer *.cpp -lm -lGL -lGLU -lglut; and ./RayTracer`

This assignment received the a B+ grade, according to the spec laid out in spec.pdf

Here's a joke: How do graphics programmers keep their projects together?  
They use GLEW!
