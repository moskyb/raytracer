## An OpenGL 2 Raytracer

Build with: `g++ -Wall -o RayTracer *.cpp -lm -lGL -lGLU -lglut && ./RayTracer`, making sure that you have OpenGL 2 (ew) installed.
If you're using fish (or some other non-POSIX shell), use `g++ -Wall -o RayTracer *.cpp -lm -lGL -lGLU -lglut; and ./RayTracer`

Here's a joke: How do graphics programmers keep their projects together?  
They use GLEW!
